# SixFrameTranslation
Software written to convert DNA fasta files to Protein fasta files via six-frame-translation. This software can be
used to produce protein fasta files which can serve as the input database to the MersSplicer. Did not produce a user 
manual for this software as it was only used by Arpit and I to create databases for testing the MersSplicer software.
